1. Green

    Lower Limit: np.array([35, 50, 50])

    Upper Limit: np.array([85, 255, 255])

        Notes: Covers a wide range of typical greens. Adjust saturation/value lower bounds based on lighting.

2. Red

    Red wraps around the 0/179 boundary in the Hue channel, so two ranges are typically needed and combined with cv2.bitwise_or().

    Range 1 (Lower Hues):

        Lower Limit: np.array([0, 70, 70])

        Upper Limit: np.array([10, 255, 255])

    Range 2 (Higher Hues):

        Lower Limit: np.array([165, 70, 70])

        Upper Limit: np.array([179, 255, 255])

        Notes: Adjust Saturation/Value lower bounds (e.g., 70) depending on how bright/dark or washed-out the red is.

3. Orange

    Lower Limit: np.array([8, 100, 100])

    Upper Limit: np.array([25, 255, 255])

        Notes: Lies between red and yellow. Saturation and Value are often high for bright oranges.

4. Yellow

    Lower Limit: np.array([20, 100, 100])

    Upper Limit: np.array([35, 255, 255])

        Notes: Relatively narrow Hue range. Sensitive to lighting changes which affect Value and Saturation.

5. Blue

    Lower Limit: np.array([90, 70, 70])

    Upper Limit: np.array([130, 255, 255])

        Notes: Covers cyans through royal blues. Adjust Saturation/Value lower bounds based on the specific blue shade and lighting.
